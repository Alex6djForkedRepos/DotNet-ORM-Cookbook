## October 2025

Updated all projects to .NET 8.0.

Updated all ORMs to the latest version.

Restructured the RepoDB tests to fix connection leak and better match the pattern used for the other ORMs.

Add ExecuteDelete demonstration for EF Core.

## July 2022

### Shared Changes

Added indexes in order to reduce test run times. Thank you [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store) for showing which queries were causing the problem. Total run time dropped from around 7 minutes to less than 2.

ORMs that use `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` need to add `TrustServerCertificate=True` to their connection string. Alternately, a trusted SSL Certificate can be installed in the database. For more information see [SqlConnectionStringBuilder.TrustServerCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnectionstringbuilder.trustservercertificate?view=sqlclient-dotnet-standard-4.1).

Updated dependencies. If an ORM itself is updated, the new version number will be noted below.

### ADO

No changes other than dependencies.

### Dapper

No changes other than dependencies.

### DbConnector

No changes other than dependencies.

### Entity Framework

No changes other than dependencies.

### Entity Framework Core

* Update `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.*` to version 6.0.6
* Update `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL` to version 6.0.5

### LinqToDB

* Update `linq2db` to version 4.1.0.
* Breaking change to API (see below).
* Replace `System.Data.SqlClient` with `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`. Failing to do so is a runtime error.

This syntax is no longer allowed.

```csharp
public class OrmCookbook : DataConnection
{
	public ITable<Department> Department => GetTable<Department>();
```

Due to an API change, we now have to write,

```csharp
public class OrmCookbook : DataConnection
{
	public ITable<Department> Department => this.GetTable<Department>();
```

It appears that a method has been replaced by an extension method.

### LLBLGen Pro

* Update `SD.LLBLGen.Pro.*` to version 5.9.1.
* Reran code generator.

### NHibernate

* Update `NHibernate` to version 5.3.12

### RepoDB

* Update `RepoDb` to version 1.12.10
* Update `RepoDb.SqlServer` to version 1.1.5
* Update `RepoDb.SqlServer.BulkOperations` to version 1.1.6

The `SortByNonExistentColum` test is failing. See bug report https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB/issues/1049

### ServiceStack

* Update `ServiceStack.OrmLite` to version 6.1.0
* Update `ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer` to version 6.1.0

### Tortuga Chain

* Update `Tortuga.Chain.*` to version 4.3.0
* Replace obsolete `TableAndView` attribute with separate `Table` and `View` attributes.
* The `IClass1DataSource` interface no longer exists. Use feature interfaces such as `ICrudDataSource` instead. 
* The `DeleteWithFilter` method is now called `DeleteSet`.
* The `GetByKeyList` method is replaced by `GetByColumnList` when searching by a non-key column.
